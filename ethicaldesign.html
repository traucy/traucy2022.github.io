      <h1>
        Be a facilitator
      </h1>
      <p>
        Have a critical lens and bring an outside perspective. Don’t impose your ideas, you are there to create a space of creative discovery.
      </p>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Don’t Impose: Are you privileging your ideas? Or speaking over?
      </h4>



      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h1>
        Reflect on your biases
      </h1>
      <p>
        Biases dictate the spaces you enter and who you are accountable to. Not all spaces are yours to design in, sometimes the best option is inaction.
      </p>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Biases: What is your position in the world? Your privilege? Your lens?
      </h4>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Who: both human & non-human
      </h4>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Inaction: Are you the right design for this? Is this the right time?
      </h4>



      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h1>
        Critical Use of Tools
      </h1>
      <p>
        Be critical of tools & methodologies, know their strengths and weaknesses. Most design tools were created by & for western designers & humans, so they may replicate marginalization.
      </p>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Strengths and weaknesses: Who do they favour? Who do they disadvantage?
      </h4>



      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h1>
        Respect Current Practices
      </h1>
      <p>
        Respect the current practices of communities - they are foundational & need to be understood. Uplift already working solutions, not all challenges need new designs.
      </p>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Uplift already working solutions: Are you taking into consideration traditional, indigenous, and local knowledge?
      </h4>



      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h1>
        Intersectional Ecosystem
      </h1>
      <p>
        Create an intersectional ecosystem that considers non-humans, history, & communities.
      </p>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Intersectionality: Identity as race, gender, class, and sexual orientation and how they overlap
      </h4>



      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h1>
        Everyone Designs
      </h1>
      <p>
        Design is decision making, not all design is called design. Communities define what it is and its use to overcome collective challenges.
      </p>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Not all design is called design: Do non-human entities design?
      </h4>



      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h1>
        Centre the Most Impacted
      </h1>
      <p>
        Those most affected should have the most say in the process. We can’t design for everyone, but ensure that those most marginalized are not left out of solutions.
      </p>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Can’t design for everyone: Who are you leaving out and how are you doing it?
      </h4>



      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h1>
        Multi-Lifespan Design
      </h1>
      <p>
        Design for multiple lifespans where designers are held accountable for the work they put into the world and how it evolves. Understand how you may be leaving behind or impacting non-humans.
      </p>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Multiple-Lifespan: What will your design look like in 20 years? 50? 100?
      </h4>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Non-humans: Environment, Nature, Situations, Things, Robots, AI + Machine Learning
      </h4>



      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h1>
        On a Smaller Scale
      </h1>
      <p>
        Small scale/situated projects that deeply impact a community should be prioritized over large-scale projects for the majority.
      </p>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Impact: Value impact over intention
      </h4>



      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h1>
        Design is Political
      </h1>
      <p>
        All design choices and actions are political, therefore reflection and constant critique is needed.
      </p>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Political: What are your own values? Are there value tensions?
      </h4>


      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h1>
        Ground in Research
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ground your decisions in research. Research is continual, ongoing, and should be a large part of your process.
      </p>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Research: this can take shape in many forms, look outside of the traditional sense
      </h4>



      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h1>
        Collaborate
      </h1>
      <p>
        Collectively & transparently design with the community. Aim to make decisions with, not for, where anyone can participate.
      </p>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Collectively: Use participatory workshops, discussions and receive community feedback throughout the process
      </h4>
      <h4 class="blue-text">
        Transparently: Did you communicate your design values? How are you making your decisions?
      </h4>
