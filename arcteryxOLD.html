      <h1>Initiating product care habits for new customers in order to retain brand trust and support Arc’teryx’s sustainability goals.</h1>
      <div class="bigspacer"></div>
      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        For a senior interaction design course at Simon Fraser University, our team was tasked with seeking a local organization in Vancouver whose values we shared. <a class="red-color underline" href="https://arcteryx.com/" target="_blank">Arc'teryx</a>’s philosophy as a design company and commitment to sustainability resonated with our team, and we had the pleasure of collaborating with the Kitsilano and Metrotown branches.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>
        Conducted on-site ethnography, user research and interviews, and led the visual design of presentation slides. Designed and prototyped online experience of receiving product care gifts. Facilitated remote co-design workshop and design sprints. Designed, ideated and illustrated product care gifts.
      </p>
    </div>

      <div class="col-1of2 grey-bg ">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p class="grey-bg">
          Through interviews and ethnography, it was discovered that Arc'teryx customers, especially online customers, are unaware of proper product care for their garments. Customers have misconceptions that Arc’teryx’s reputation for great quality and high price point means that garments do not need care.
        </p>
        <!-- <div class="spacer grey-bg"></div>
        <h4>Jump to the research</h4> -->
      </div>
      <div class="col-2of2 grey-bg ">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p class="grey-bg">
          Customers are better equipped with product care knowledge through an ecosystem of physical and digital artifacts that brings delight to a familiar post-purchase shopping experience.
        </p>
        <h4 class="blue-text">For Arc'teryx</h4>
        <p class="grey-bg">Their sustainability goals are met with fewer replacements and creates confidence that product care education takes place. </p>
        <h4 class="blue-text">For Customers</h4>
        <p class="grey-bg">There is trust that their Arc’teryx garments will last a lifetime with regular care.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="written">
      <h4>Presenting:</h4>
      <h2>A product care journey that begins at the checkout, with a gift</h2>
      <p>
        Arc'teryx customers are able to choose a free product care Magnet or Bandana upon purchasing an item, online or in-store. Gifts are provided to add delight into the purchasing experience and make product care knowledge easily accessible in every customer’s home.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Arc’teryx, the short-term loss of fabricating these gifts with recycled materials can lead to long-term gains with brand loyalty, trust, and sustainability.

    <div class="written">
      <h2>Email Touchpoint</h2>
      <p>
        Right before online customers receive their product, an email is sent with product care information. Although it’s exciting to use a new product, it's recommended to wash the jacket before use to increase the longevity of the waterproof material.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Arc’teryx product guides educate people in-store, we identified an opportunity to design for online customers after discovering that there are no current product care touchpoints when ordering garments on the Arc'teryx website.

        <p>
          Designed to live in the laundry room or closet, the magnet is a product care guide made from Gore-tex scraps. The back of the grommet is magnetic, so people can stick it on their laundry machines. The hole allows people to hang the magnet on hangers or hooks.

    <div class="written">
      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>
        There was no brief. Our team had to do the research, seek a problem, and design an intervention for that area.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started with ethnographic research by visiting and observing each store across the lower mainland to understand their unique programs. During hour-long sessions of undercover browsing, we took field notes, photos, and conducted interviews with product guides regarding customer-employee interactions.
      </p>

    <div class="written">
      <h1>Insights</h1>
      <p>
        We conducted 8 qualitative interviews seeking to understand motivations, behaviors, and rituals. Our interviewees consisted of athletes, outdoor enthusiasts, urban commuters, techwear fans, and casual shoppers.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h2>01</h2>
        <h3>Customers believe it is damaging to machine wash or dry their garments.</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>02</h2>
        <h3>Customers believe that Arc’teryx’s reputation for quality and the high price point mean that products do not need care.</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="spacer"></div>

      <div>
        <h2>03</h2>
        <h3>Customers are unaware of proper product care procedures, especially when ordering online.</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="spacer"></div>

      <p>
        Our interviews also confirmed that customers care for their garments in unconventional and potentially damaging ways, listening to advice from friends and family.
      </p>

      <h3 class="red-text">
        “I learned the hard way that you're supposed to wash these jackets regularly/often to keep the waterproofness etc.  Basically something went wrong when I once washed my Beta AR.”

    <div class="written">
      <h1>Experience Mapping</h1>
      <p>With the data from our interviewees and the help of Arc'teryx employees, we mapped common journeys that customers may take, from their first connection with Arc’teryx, to active garment use, and eventual replacement.</p>

      <h1>Design Focus</h1>
      <p>
        We quickly understood that a post-purchase intervention, communicating the importance of product care, would renew trust in Arc’teryx’s lasting quality, and help Arc’teryx achieve sustainable goals.
      </p>

      <p>The patterns in our research ultimately led to framing our design question as:</p>
      <h2>How might we dispel misconceptions by facilitating post-purchase self-learning on why and how garments should be cared for?</h2>

    <div class="written">
      <h1>Co-Design Workshop</h1>
      <p>
        I helped facilitate a 1h 30min online workshop (quarantine style) using Miro to better understand the wants, needs, desires and feasibility of ideas for an intervention. In this workshop we better understood the lens of product care through Arc'teryx employees. Together we did activities like Visual Toolkit, Mashup, Spider, Crazy 8's and made a journey map.

        Over the course of a few weeks, we came up with over 100 online and in-store 100 ideas, with each intervention tackling product care in its own way.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        Our team's process throughout this project was never linear, it was constantly diverging and converging from critiques and meetings with Arc'teryx, our peers, and ourselves.
        We often struggled to pick a direction to pursue, like deciding which one of the hundreds of artifacts would be the most beneficial for the customer and Arc’teryx. I learned that when designers have the power to shape experiences and direct people's behaviour, we should do it in a way where they can respond.
        Together, we aimed to create a supportive experience that consisted of artifacts that fit a variety of lifestyles, chosen by customers.
